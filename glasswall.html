      <p id="aboutglasswall">&#8195;The Glass Wall Game Engine (Glass Wall) started as a small OpenGL wrapper and began taking shape as a performance based game-engine. Glass Wall is mostly in development so a lot of features are mostly concepts that are kept in mind when forming the structure. The github repository is <a href="https://github.com/BadByteGames/GlassWall">here</a>. The engine is a STATIC C++ library that uses CMake in order to generate project files for several build systems. Windows users should use vcpkg to get dependencies when building.<br/>
      &#8195;Since the engine is currently in development, there is no documentation for it as a lot of concepts can change on the spot. Currently, the engine is all in a class "World" that is the central interaction point for entities, the render engine, and input management. Each entity has a root component with sub components being models, cameras, and any other things that an entity could use. As of now, the features list shown below are concepts that are planned for the future course of the game engine and are central concepts to it.</p>
      <ul id="features">
        <li>User Programmable Shaders</li>
        <li>Simplistic Entity System</li>
        <li>Physics Focused</li>
        <li>C++ API</li>
      </ul>
